class MPC:
    """
    A Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework.

    Attributes:
        model (function): A function that takes the current state and control input as input and returns the next state of the system.
        horizon (int): The prediction horizon (the number of steps into the future to make predictions).
        Q (float): The weighting matrix for the state prediction error term in the cost function.
        R (float): The weighting matrix for the control input error term in the cost function.
